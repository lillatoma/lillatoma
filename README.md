Currently employed at Yigsoft Kft. as a UI and Engine developer.



## Projects

### DaiCastle:
An offline 2D top-down 100-player battle-royale game. This game was made using C++ and SFML. I started and discontinued the project in 2019, but I picked it up later in 2021 to finish, and even update it. The game features a huge map with several points of interests, a complex AI, an inventory system, an unlockable item system, a replay system, and many more.

### BombermanTypeCPP:
My first Unreal Engine Project based on the well-known Bomberman game. I utilized Gameplay Ability System in the project.

### Cell Wars:
My oldest game project with graphics. It is a node-based strategy game with 15 levels. Later, I remade the game and added 2 new features: a skill system, and a random map generator in case the player finishes the first 15 maps.
